January 31,2021 The last Will and Testament of Johnny " Money Man" Brown. 

This is Johnny "Money Man" Brown . If your reading this,it means I am no longer in this world. Over my 66 years of life I have amassed 9 billion dollars worth of assets( buildings, cars, jewelery, mortgage notes, index funds, stocks, bonds, tech companies, and crypto). As my aire, you get to select one of these assets to build your welath form.

During my time, I was able to dodge paying taxes for 60 years, due to some interesting accounting and tax shelters. I lived a great life. The money, the cars, the POWER. So here it is kid, have fun and make me proud.
